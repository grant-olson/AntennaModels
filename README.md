This is a place to stash my workspace for various antenna models for
amateur radio. Some of the antennas match my back yard setup, but
others are more archytypal antennas such as a generic multiband
vertical.  If the generic ones help you get started, please feel free
to use them as you wish.

All software listed is Windows-only but runs in Wine:
